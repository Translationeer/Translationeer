# General Usage

Translationeer is designed for those who translate texts and literature from languages other than English to and from English. It is accessible as a website over the internet and can also be downloaded. Currently it only supports Latin.

Users create accounts to store documents that include texts and translations of separate sections. Users can divide the sections how they wish and click on words in the text to lookup their definitions. Text can be selected and broken off into its own separate section, and sections can be added or merged together. Commonly, a piece of text that is to be translated is pasted into a Translationeer document, that document is translated in Translationeer, and then the translation is copied and pasted somewhere. 

Translationeer can also be used in test mode without an account, by using a pre-made template or a blank doucment. This can be found on the homepage. Test mode is only intended to be used by those who want to try Translationeer out and learn the basics of how to use Translationeer.
