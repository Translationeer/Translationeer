# Migrating from Version 1

## Your Account

If you created your account from version 1, you may still log in with Google to access your account contents. Make sure to use the same Google account when logging in

## Your Documents

Version 2 uses a different method of keeping time, therefore dashboards may not list the documents in order of time last edited if you account was created in version 1. Documents may be retreived out of order and listed with incorrect times as well. Save all documents in version 2 to update the time created in the correct format. The documents will not be retreived in order until this is done for all documents previously created in version 1.

### Line Breaks

Version 1 escaped linebreaks with the sequence "&&linebreak&", which is deprecated in version 2. Therefore, all linebreaks from previously saved documents in version 1 will have the text "&&linebreak&" where ever a line break was present.
