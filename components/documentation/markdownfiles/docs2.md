**See Step 3 if on Test Mode**

## Step 1: Create an Account

Create an account to save all your translations. On the homepage, you can create an account using an email and password (recommended) or using a Google account. You will be asked to accept Translationeer's policies and then directed to your dashboard.

## Step 2: Create a Document: Paste in Some Text!

Every new translation is a "document". You will see all your documents listed on your dashboard. Click the "Add a Document" button to create a new document. Give the document a name and paste in the text you want to translate. For example, you could paste in an excerpt from Ceasar's Gallic Wars if you're translating Latin. 

## Step 3: Translate!

In a document, you will see the original text on the left side, and you will write your translation on the right side. Start typing up a translation! While translating, you will have access to all of Translationeer's tools to organize and help with your translation.

### Click on Words

On the left side of the document, click on any word to view it's definition. 

Make sure that in the page header, the language is correct and your desired translators are turned on. You can toggle what language and what translators to use in the page header, default language is "Latin to English".

Use your mouse to drag the definition box around.

Click the pen icon to edit the word to lookup. When editing, you can highlight text in the definition.

### Select Text and Break Off Text

On the left side, select some text. On the document header, there will be a button to "Break Off Text". Click on this button and the selected text will be broken up into it's own separate section. 

Select and break off sections of text to organize your translation into logical and manageable pieces!
