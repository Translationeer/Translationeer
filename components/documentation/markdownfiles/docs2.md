## Step 1: Create an Account

Create an account to save all your translations. On the homepage, you can create an account using an email and password (recommended) or using a Google account. You will be asked to accept Translationeer's policies and then directed to your dashboard.

## Step 2: Create a Document: Paste in Some Text!

Every new translation you do is a "document". You will see all your documents listed on your dashboard. Click the "Add a Document" button to create a new document. Give the document a name and paste in the text you want to translate. For example, you could paste in an excerpt from Ceasar's Gallic Wars if you're translating Latin.
