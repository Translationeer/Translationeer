# Test Mode

Test Mode is a way to test out Translationeer without creating an account or saving a document. It is intended to be used for experimental purposes. 

Test Mode creates an example document for you to use and edit. Please see the reference for a document to see how to use Translationeer's tools: [documentation/document](documentation/document);
