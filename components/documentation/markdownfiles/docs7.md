# Test Mode

Test Mode is a way to test out Translationeer without creating an account or saving a document. It is intended to be used for experimental purposes. 

Test Mode creates an example document for you to use and edit. Please see the reference for a document to see how to use Translationeer's tools: [documentation/document](documentation/document);

**No changes made in Test Mode will be saved.** Create an account and a document to save your changes. All other features of a Translationer document will work in Test Mode


## Accessing Test Mode

Test Mode is accessible from the homepage. You have the option to pick a template to get started translating with. 

The path for test mode is `/test/[template]`. If [template] is "blank", then a blank document will be generated. If it is a Translationeer template name like "aenied", a document based on that template will be generated.
